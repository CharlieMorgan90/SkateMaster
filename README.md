# SkateMaster
Project proposal code for my game SkateMaster.

How to run code:
1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer. Python 3 comes pre-installed on macOS, but you may need to update to the latest      version. Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed. If not, download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the 
   installation instructions. Install pygame to your computer by typing "pip install pygame" into your terminal. On VScode you may want to     install the Python extension by Microsoft. On the left side bar there is an extensions button click it and search Python and it should      come up.
2. Download the SkateboardDemo folder to your desktop. If you can't download the folder then create a new folder on your desktop and add 
   the two files to it.
3. In VS Code, go to File > Open... and navigate to the location where you downloaded the SkateboardDemo folder. Select the folder and 
   click Open.
4. Run the code (top right arrow). Or open a new terminal window on VScode, type "python3 skateboard.py", and press enter to run the 
   script. The Pygame window displaying the skateboard animation should open. Press the spacebar to do the trick.
